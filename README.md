# Simple Linear Regression

This project demonstrates how to implement **Simple Linear Regression** in Python using scikit-learn.  
It uses a dataset of `height-weight.csv` to predict a person's height based on their weight, walking through data exploration, model training, and evaluation.

## Project Overview

The notebook **Simple Linear Regression.ipynb** shows step-by-step how to:

1. Load and explore the dataset with pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn.  
2. Visualize the relationship between height and weight.  
3. Split the dataset into training and testing sets.  
4. Standardize features using `StandardScaler`.  
5. Train a simple linear regression model with scikit-learn.  
6. Evaluate performance using metrics like RÂ², MAE, MSE, and RMSE.  
7. Plot the regression line and compare predictions vs. actual values.
